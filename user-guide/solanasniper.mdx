SolanaSniper extends BTS V3 beyond EVM networks. It listens to Solana-focused Telegram channels, buys SPL tokens through Jupiter, and executes your preferred exit strategy.

## How to use SolanaSniper

1. Run `/start` and switch to **Solana** using **Change Chain / DEX**.
2. Fund the displayed SOL address (see **Wallet Info**).
3. Navigate to `/settings → Solana Settings` to configure trading, wallet, gas, and channel options.
4. Launch the bot via **Auto buy / sell (MultiSniper) (Solana)** or the `/solana` command.

## Configuration overview

### Trading settings

- Toggle buying/selling independently.
- Pick a trading mode: `MANUAL_SELLING`, `BASIC_AUTOSELL`, `SELL_AFTER_TIME_DELAY`, or `TRAILING_STOP_LOSS` (Pro).
- Set total allowed snipes and whether the bot may re-buy previously sold tokens.
- **Simulation mode** – Enable dry runs without touching real funds and set the virtual SOL balance.
- **Buy settings** – Define buy amount (SOL) and slippage percentage.
- **Sell settings** – Configure auto sell percentage, TP/SL multipliers, delay in **seconds**, and Trailing Stop Loss parameters (Pro).

### Wallet, gas, and channels

- **Wallet management** – Import or generate Solana wallets from the settings menu.
- **Gas controls** – Set the priority fee (SOL) and compute unit limit to handle congested periods.
- **Node settings (Pro)** – Provide a custom Solana RPC endpoint if needed.
- **Monitored channels** – Add Telegram sources to follow; each can carry its own keyword filters.

## Trading modes

- **Manual selling** – Hold positions until you exit manually with `/sell`.
- **Basic autosell** – Sell when the TP or SL target is hit.
- **Sell after time delay** – Exit after a specified number of seconds.
- **Trailing stop loss (Pro)** – Locks in gains by tracking the peak price and selling after a configured drop.
