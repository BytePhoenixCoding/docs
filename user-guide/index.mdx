## General information

- **Tiers** – Everyone starts on the Free tier. Upgrade to Pro inside the bot to remove trading fees and unlock premium controls like trailing stop loss and advanced filters.
- **Fees** – Free-tier trades incur a 1% fee on profitable exits. The bot automatically collects fees when the owed amount crosses a small threshold.
- **Security** – BTS stores keys securely, but for maximum safety we recommend a dedicated "burner" wallet plus frequent transfers of profits to long-term storage.
- **Help** – Use `/help` or the Help menu in Telegram anytime. Our [community chat](https://t.me/BlockchainTokenSniper) is also open 24/7.
