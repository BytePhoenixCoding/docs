BlockchainTokenSniper V3 is a complete rebuild that runs entirely through [`@btsv3bot`](https://t.me/btsv3bot). There is no executable to download, and prior desktop licenses do not automatically transfer. This guide explains how to get oriented and how legacy tiers map to the new Pro experience.

## Important security notice

<Note>
  Treat the in-bot wallet as a hot wallet. Keep only the funds you need for active snipes, frequently sweep profits to a hardware or custodial wallet, and don't store large balances in the bot for long periods.
</Note>

## Key differences in V3

- **Fresh architecture** – V3 is not a patch to V1/V2. It is a Telegram-native platform with its own settings, wallet system, and automation stack.
- **Telegram-first UX** – Tier management, wallet imports, and bot controls all live inside `@btsv3bot`.
- **New tier model** – Tiers are linked to your Telegram account instead of a wallet address, so you can rotate wallets freely without losing benefits.
- **Free vs. Pro** – Everyone starts on the free tier (with a 1% trading fee). Upgrading unlocks every premium feature and removes trading fees.

## Getting started on V3

1. Open [`@btsv3bot`](https://t.me/btsv3bot) in Telegram and run `/start`.
2. Follow the guided onboarding to configure your wallet, preferred chains, and desired sniper.
3. Visit **My Account → Tier & Billing** to review upgrade options or confirm your legacy entitlement.

## Legacy tier accommodations

If you previously held a paid tier in V1/V2, contact [@BytePhoenix](https://t.me/BytePhoenix) on Telegram with proof of purchase (username, tier level, transaction ID, etc.). Eligible users are granted complimentary Pro access based on their original tier:

| Previous tier | Complimentary V3 access |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Bronze        | 3 months of Pro         |
| Silver        | 6 months of Pro         |
| Gold          | 12 months of Pro        |
| Diamond       | Lifetime Pro            |

  Migration unlocks are handled manually so we can verify ownership and keep the system secure. Please allow time for validation.
