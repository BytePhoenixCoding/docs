## Experience the next generation of crypto sniping

BlockchainTokenSniper (BTS) V3 is a fully managed Telegram bot suite (`@btsv3bot`) built for modern mempool sniping, channel-driven trading, and automated selling strategies. Configure everything inside Telegram, keep real-time visibility on your open positions, and let the bot react faster than manual trading ever could.

## BlockchainLaunchSniper (EVM)

LaunchSniper targets a single token address and reacts the instant trading is enabled or liquidity is added.

- Works on any EVM chain supported by BTS (Ethereum, BSC, Base, Sepolia testnet, and more).
- Multiple entry styles: mempool snipes, enable-trading snipes, instant buys, or scheduled buys at a timestamp.
- Mix and match sell strategies—manual exits, take-profit/stop-loss, sell-after-delay, or trailing stop loss.
- Integrated trading checker catches honeypots and high-tax traps before funds are committed.
- Custom RPCs per chain plus automatic fallback nodes keep transactions moving.

## BlockchainMultiSniper (EVM)

MultiSniper is the automation workhorse: give it Telegram channels, whitelisted keywords, and risk limits, and it will trade on your behalf.

- Channel-aware buying with per-channel allow/deny keyword filters (Pro).
- Liquidity pair management so you can prioritize the most efficient pool for each chain.
- Auto-sell percentages and partial exits to keep moon bags while banking profits.
- Rich activity feed in Telegram showing cost basis, live multipliers, and realized P&L per token.

## BlockchainSolanaSniper

The Solana-focused sniper relies on Jupiter (Jup.ag) for routing and matches the speed of Solana-native traders.

- Supports manual, autosell, time-delay, and trailing stop-loss exits across SPL tokens.
- Simulation mode helps you validate settings without risking SOL.
- Customizable priority fees, compute limits, and RPC endpoints.
- Channel monitoring and keyword filtering tailored for Solana call groups.

## Supported networks in V3

BTS V3 currently covers the major EVM networks plus Solana. Review exact router contracts, chain IDs, and Jupiter integration details in the [supported blockchains](/supported-blockchains) reference.

## How to start sniping

1. Open [`@btsv3bot`](https://t.me/btsv3bot) and run `/start`.
2. Choose **Change Chain / DEX** to select your preferred network and fund the wallet shown under **Wallet Info**.
3. Visit **/settings** to configure the bot you plan to use, then launch it from the main menu.

The [quickstart guide](/quickstart) walks through the entire onboarding workflow, including wallet and security tips.

## Tiers, fees, and referrals

Every user begins on the Free tier (1% fee on profitable trades). Upgrading to Pro removes trading fees and unlocks every advanced control. Read the [tiers & fees](/tiers) page for the latest details and learn how the [referral system](/referral-system) shares discounts and commissions.

## Our story

BlockchainTokenSniper began as a small script published to GitHub more than four years ago. Community interest exploded, so we opened a Telegram group, grew beyond 2,500 members, and kept iterating. LaunchSniper and MultiSniper expanded beyond BSC to multiple EVM chains, and in the V3 era we rebuilt everything for a Telegram-native experience. What started as a niche launch sniping tool is now a full trading suite with specialized bots, modern safety checks, and a roadmap driven by active traders like you.
