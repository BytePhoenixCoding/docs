## Everything happens inside Telegram

There is no desktop download or extra installer for BTS V3. Start a conversation with [`@btsv3bot`](https://t.me/btsv3bot) and the bot will walk you through wallet creation, funding, tier upgrades, and launching the individual snipers. The same chat is where you monitor fills, edit settings, and receive system alerts.

<Note>
  If you are coming from BTS V1/V2, review the [migration guide](/migration) to understand how legacy tiers map to the new system.
</Note>

## Get started in three steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch the bot and pick a chain">
    Run `/start`, then choose **Change Chain / DEX** to pick the network you want to trade on. Every chain has its own preset buy amount, gas profile, and liquidity sources that you can customize later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fund the wallet shown in Wallet Info">
    The Telegram UI displays your on-chain address. Transfer the native token (e.g., ETH, BNB, SOL) you want to trade with. Free-tier users will incur a 1% fee on profitable trades; Pro traders enjoy fee-free fills.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the sniper you plan to run">
    Open `/settings` and drill into **LaunchSniper**, **MultiSniper**, or **Solana Settings**. Set slippage, buy size, sell strategy, limits, monitored channels, and safety checks before hitting the **Start** button on the main menu.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recommended checklist before trading

- **Choose the right sniper**: LaunchSniper is for single token contracts, MultiSniper automates Telegram alpha, and SolanaSniper covers SPL tokens routed through Jupiter.
- **Verify your sell logic**: Decide between manual exits, basic autosell (TP/SL), sell-after-delay, or Trailing Stop Loss (Pro).
- **Review trading checker thresholds**: Set maximum buy/sell taxes and honeypot detection so the bot can block malicious contracts.
- **Consider Pro tier**: Upgrade directly in the bot to unlock trailing stop loss, channel keyword filters, and fee-free trading. See [tiers & fees](/tiers) for details.

## Safety best practices

<Info>
  Never park long-term funds inside the trading wallet. Use it as an active trading balance, sweep profits to a separate wallet, and keep backups of any private keys you import.
</Info>

- Use `/help` or the in-bot Help menu whenever you need a refresher on commands.
- Keep Telegram notifications enabled for `@btsv3bot` so you see fills, errors, and take-profit events in real time.
- Browse the [user guides](/user-guide/index) for feature-by-feature walkthroughs of each sniper.
